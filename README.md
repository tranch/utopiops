No matter how many times you do it, starting a new project from scratch means spending from a few minutes to a few hours to set up just the boilerplate.
Utopiops-kick-starter helps you build such boilerplate for various projects in a few steps.

This repository also provides the templates for various front-end and back-end frameworks and languages with necessary components that simplify using the cloud services.
