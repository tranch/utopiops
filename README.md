Utopiops is the best way for teams of any size to use cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP), with or without prior experience.

We provide a platform that helps you focus only on writing code and building the product without being concerned about any of the followings:
* Provisioning the infrastructure to host the application
* Setting up the CI/CD server
* Implementing the CI/CD pipelines
* Embedding the monitoring agents and integrations to gather logs/metrics
* Setting up monitoring and alerting systems

We believe in providing a single place with a developer-first approach to cover the whole DevOps lifecycle.
